# Price Prediction For Airbnb Listings #

For this project you will need to install python and the modules listed in src/requirements.txt.

Then, the project is divided into four main sections: fetching the data, pre-processing, performing EDA, and creating a predictive model. To access each of these steps (in order):
      
      1) Open JupyterLab
      2) Run src/dataInfastructure.ipynb
      3) Using OpenRefine, create a new project with data/initial_data/listings_complex.csv and run src/listings_complex_cleaning.json to perform cleaning steps.
            a) Ensure the 'csv' setting is selected in OpenRefine
            b) Name the output data/cleaned_data/listings_complex.csv
      4) Run src/EDA.ipynb
      5) Run src/ML.ipynb

Alternatively, to only review the results download and view the EDA.html and ML.html in the webbrowser of your choice.
